I like to treat performance as a dialogue between design and technology. Micro-interactions should feel smooth without sacrificing accessibility or readability. That means caring about bundle size as much as the details: subtle animations, predictable loading times, and clear states while information arrives.

A practice I repeat in every project is writing performance budgets before design starts. With clear limits (max image weight, time to first render, number of external fonts), it’s easier to make design decisions that won’t compromise the experience.
