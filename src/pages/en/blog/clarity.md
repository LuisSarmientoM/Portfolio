A good component doesn’t just look right—it communicates intent. Whenever I create a new piece, I document states, constraints, and edge cases. That guide is what helps the team maintain quality without relying on shared memory.

In recent projects, it has helped to clarify from the very first sketch:

- What problem the component solves—and what it doesn’t.
- Which properties can be combined without breaking the interface.
- How it behaves on small screens, with screen readers, or under fast interactions.

Clarity doesn’t happen on its own. You have to write short notes, record examples, and keep a repository of stories so anyone can confirm the component still delivers on its promise.
