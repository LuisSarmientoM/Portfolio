I alternate weeks of exploration with weeks of consolidation. In the first, I try new tools without fear of breaking anything; in the second, I document what worked, remove experiments, and standardize reusable code snippets.

This rhythm avoids two extremes: staying stuck in experimentation or getting trapped in perfection. With a biweekly cadence, I can measure which experiments are worth keeping and which processes I should improve so the team can adopt them.
